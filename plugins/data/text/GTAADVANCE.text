 YOU'RE IGNORANCE IS LIKE A CRY OF HELP FROM THE DARK - I AM MULTI-TONGUED AND SPEAK FIVE VARIATIONS OF SPANISH. SHE IS THE NIECE OF ASUKA, THE BOSS OF THE YAKUZA. THEY AREN'T ALLOWING ME TO MOVE MY MERCHANDISE IN THEIR AREA OF TOWN. DO THIS THING FOR ME AND BE NICE TO THE GIRL; THEY HAVE SUCH LOVELY UNIFORMS.

A COUPLE OF FRIENDS OF THE POLICE HAVE BEEN TAKING BRIBES FROM JOEY FOR SOME INFO ON PATROLS.
A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WAS PUT IN THE HOSPITAL BY THE THUGS OF A TWO-TIMER NAMED SCORELLI. NOW IT'S PAYBACK TIME. TAKE OUT SOME OF HIS GOONS AND STEAL SCORELLI'S CAR OVER IN HARWOOD. IT'S DANGEROUS, BUT I KNOW YOU CAN HANDLE IT.
A WORD OF WARNING, HE HAS A SHORT TEMPER, SO WATCH YOUR MOUTH OR YOU COULD END UP WITH A CRACKED SKULL.
AFTER THAT LAST JOB, THIS ONE SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM.  EXCEPT THESE TWO CARS ARE MAFIA CARS, AND THOSE GUYS DON'T LIKE GETING ROBBED.
AH, AMIGO, YOU ARE BACK EARLY I SEE. DID YOU RUN INTO DIFFICULTIES?
AH, AMIGO. YOU MUST SERVE SOME TIME IN DETENTION, I'M AFRAID. PERHAPS YOU COULD READ A BOOK ON EVASIVE TACTICS?
AH, YOUR HANDS ARE MADE OF IRON, AMIGO. I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN THAT KING COURTNEY THAT SENT YOU AGAINST ME. I TELL YOU IN TRUTH THAT I DON'T KNOW YOU OR HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST YOU OR YOUR ASSOCIATES.
AHH! KNEE-HIGH BOOTS WITH A 12-INCH WOODEN HEEL! VERY POPULAR AMONG VERTICALLY - CHALLENGED PEOPLE. FABULOUS! TELL CISCO I'LL GET TO WORK ON THESE RIGHT AWAY ONCE HE PAYS ME FOR LAST WEEK'S WORK.
AHH! MIKE-SAMA, HOW ARE YOU? I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE ME AT THE MERCY OF THESE MEAN MEN! YOU'RE MY HERO!
AHH! SOMEBODY HIT ME. MUST BE ON THEIR CELLPHONE AND NOT PAYING ANY DAMN ATTENTION.
AHH, DAMN! YOU CAN'T JUST STEP TO ME ON MY BASKETBALL COURT!
AHH, K-CHAN, YOU AMAZE ME WITH YOUR SUCCESS. LET ME SEE THE SHOES! AHH, BEAUTIFUL! COME WITH ME TO MY TROPHY CASE IN MY BEDROOM...
AHH, MIKE-SAN, HOW MANY POOR MAFIA SOULS HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME? %8 MAFIA THUGS, THAT'S MORE THAN I'D EXPECTED. GOOD WORK. THE FIRST BLOW HAS BEEN MADE. THE MAFIA WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE INVADING MY TERRITORY AGAIN.
AHH, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ME AT MY NAUGHTIEST YET. DON'T DISAPPOINT ME AND YOU WON'T BE PUNISHED.
AHO! I TOLD YOU NOT TO KILL THE QUARTERBACK, YOU IDIOT!
AI OPPONENTS
ALL THIS TROUBLE OVER ONE PIMP? WHY DON'T YOU SEND ONE OF YOUR REGULAR GOONS? AND WHAT THE HELL IS A SNACK BAR?
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS DRIVE. NOW WE'LL BE LATE TO THE MEETING... DAMN ROOKIE.
ALRIGHT, THAT SHOULD'VE GIVEN CISCO ENOUGH TIME TO GET TO THE CONFERENCE.
ALRIGHT, WE'RE ALMOST READY TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS DUMP. LET ME FINISH UP WITH THESE GUYS AND WE'LL BE READY TO GO. I'LL MEET YOU OVER IN CHINATOWN.

AMIGO, I HOPE MY MEN PROVED USEFUL TO YOU. SOMETIMES THEY ARE IN AWE OF BETTER MEN AND STAY BACK IN THE SHADOWS OF THEIR SUPERIORS. I DON'T LIKE TO LABEL SUCH THINGS AS COWARDICE BUT LESS REFINED PEOPLE MIGHT STATE IT AS SUCH.
AMIGO, I HOPE YOU DO NOT HAVE A FETISH FOR YOUNG SCHOOL GIRLS. I WANT YOU TO KIDNAP A YOUNG GIRL FROM IN FRONT OF HER SCHOOL AND BRING HER BACK TO ME. TRACK DOWN HER LIMO AND JACK IT, DON'T LEAVE ANY SURVIVORS. YOU NEED TO PICK YUKA UP IN THE LIMO SO HER BODYGUARDS WON'T SUSPECT ANYTHING FISHY.
AMIGO, I SEE ON MY GPS DEVICE THAT YOU ARE DEAD AND THUS, INCAPABLE OF FURTHER USE TO ME. GOODBYE.
AMIGO, I WOULD CRY IN HAPPINESS FOR YOUR SUCCESS IF I WASN'T WEARING SILK.
AMIGO, I'M SORRY TO INFORM YOU OF ANOTHER GRIEVOUS BETRAYAL. THE MAFIA ARE ON TO YOU. - CISCO
AMIGO, IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE AMIGOS IN PRISON BUT DO YOUR BEST. I WILL SEND YOU CHOCOLATE AND TOLIET PAPER.
AMIGO, IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE FRIENDS IN PRISON BUT DO YOUR BEST. I WILL SEND YOU CHOCOLATE AND TOILET PAPER.
AMIGO, IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE FRIENDS IN PRISON BUT DO YOUR BEST. I WILL SEND YOU CHOCOLATE AND TOLIET PAPER.
AMIGO, THE HEAT IS ON YOU. DON'T BRING THE HEAT ON TO MY SHOESHOPS! - CISCO
AMIGO, THERE ARE TWO GANGS THAT WOULD DEAL IN THIS MATTER - THE YARDIES AND THE YAKUZA. BUT FIRST, LET ME TEND TO MY WOUNDS AND CHANGE TO MY EVENING CLOTHES BEFORE DEALING IN MORE PLEASANTRIES WITH YOU. FOLLOW ME TO MY PLACE.
AMIGO, THERE IS NO HONOR IN FLEEING A BATTLE AFTER IT IS JOINED. BEFORE PERHAPS, BUT NOT AFTER.
AMIGO, WE ARE IN A BUBONIC PLAGUE EPIDEMIC. BRING YOUR MASK AND COME QUICKLY!
AMIGO, WE ARE NO LONGER AMIGOS. YOU LED THE POLICE TO MY FACILITIES!
AMIGO, WELL DONE! YOU CAN NOW AFFORD TO REPLACE THE RAGS ON YOUR BACK WITH FINE LINEN.
AMIGO, YOU ARE ALIVE! DID I NOT WARN YOU? DID I NOT SAY WHAT A DEVIOUS, HORRIBLE TRAP THEY HAD WAITING FOR YOU? YOU MUST SEE MY TAILOR, YOU'RE CLOTHES ARE FILTHY AND YOU SMELL LIKE A BEAST. PLEASE DO NOT SIT DOWN OR I WILL SHOOT YOU.
AMIGO, YOU ARE HEADED FOR A TRAP. COME TO MY HEADQUARTERS AT THE AIRPORT AND I'LL EXPLAIN. - CISCO.
AMIGO, YOU HAVE OPERATED ABOVE THE THRESHOLD OF WHAT LITTLE INTELLIGENCE YOU HAVE. YOU ARE TO BE CONGRATULATED! UNFORTUNATELY, I SEE NO FURTHER USE FOR YOUR SERVICE BUT I WISH YOU GOOD FORTUNE. UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN.
AMIGO, YOU MUST HAVE HEARD THE NEWS? THE CITY HAS BEEN LABELED AS BEING BUBONIC PLAGUE-INFECTED AND BUSINESS HAS BEEN SEVERELY AFFECTED. AMIGO, I NEED YOU TO BE MY DECOY THIS AFTERNOON AS I ATTEND AN IMPORTANT CONFERENCE ON THE EFFECT OF BUBONIC PLAGUE ON INNER-CITY CRIME. MY POSITION IS THAT WE SHOULD HELP FUND THE RESEARCH THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED BY THE GOVERNMENT WHILE SOME OF MY COMPETITORS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN STEALING THE VACCINE AFTER IT'S COMPLETED. THERE WILL BE SOME EFFORT TO STOP ME FROM ATTENDING THIS DRUG CONFERENCE. BUSINESS IS HURTING TOO MUCH AND WE NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION RIGHT AWAY!
AMIGO, YOU WOUND ME DEEPLY AND I WOULD HAVE YOU BEATEN BUT, AS YOU CAN SEE, THIS IS A VIRGIN WOOL RUG AND MUCH TOO PRICEY FOR YOUR BLOOD. THE BOMBER WAS SOMEONE IN MY EMPLOY AND I WANT TO FIND OUT AS MUCH AS YOU DO WHY HE WAS KILLED AND WHO DID IT. BESIDES, YOU CAN PROVE USEFUL TO ME ONCE MORE. I'LL SEND YOU SOME MEN TO HELP IF THIS MEETING DOES INDEED TURN OUT TO BE AN AMBUSH.
AMIGO, YOU'RE RUNNING IN CIRCLES! STAND AND FACE YOUR ENEMIES!
AMIGO, YOU'VE DIED AN HONORABLE DEATH. I WILL LAY SUCH BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS ON YOUR CORPSE THE LIKE OF WHICH YOU NEVER SAW IN YOUR POOR EXCUSE FOR A LIFE.

YOU THOUGHT OF ME AS A COWARD, AS SOME SISSY BOY. NO, AMIGO, I AM HERE TO TRACK DOWN THE ASSASSIN THAT HAS TAKEN OUT THE BOMBER. I WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH WHATEVER ASSISTANCE I CAN.
ASUKA SENT ME TO SUPERVISE THE OPERATION. IT'LL JUST TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO GET THESE CHUMPS ONBOARD.
ASUKA SENT US TO HELP YOU OUT, MIKE-SAN. WE'LL GIVE YOU A FEW SECONDS TO GET INTO POSITION AND THEN WE'LL ATTACK THE FRONT ENTRANCE.

HAVE YOU FOUND HIM YET? I'M GETTING IMPATIENT, MIKE-SAN! - ASUKA
HE DIDN'T COME WILLINGLY BUT HE CAME. HE DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF HIS CHANCES OF MERCY FROM YOU.
HE IS BEING TRANSFERRED FROM THE POLICE STATION TO A MORE SECURE PLACE, SO WE NEED TO ACT NOW.
HE THINKS HE CAN EXCHANGE THE CASH FOR HIS FREEDOM.
HE TOLD ME YOU'D SHOW UP BUT I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. HE SAID YOU WERE DIRECT AND DIDN'T CARE MUCH FOR SUBTLETY.
HE TOOK OFF REAL QUICK.... ON TO THESE CAR BOMBS, THEY'RE UNSTABLE. TRY NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY SET THE CAR ON FIRE.
HE'S BEEN 'RETIRED' FROM HIS COLLECTING DUTIES. THE MAFIA'S PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THIS ROUTE. HAND OVER THE BRIEFCASE.
HE'S DEAD. THE ONLY FRIEND I THOUGHT I COULD COUNT ON IN THIS GOD-FORSAKEN CITY. YOU BETRAYED ME, VINNIE, AND I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THAT.
HE'S IN A WALLED COMPOUND NORTHWEST OF HERE OFF THE HIGHWAY. A FRONTAL ASSAULT WOULD BE SUICIDE BUT MY SOURCES SAY THERE MAY BE ANOTHER WAY IN. I'LL SEND A FEW MEN TO ASSIST YOU IN THE ASSAULT.

I'M GOING TO MISS JONNIE THE BARTENDER AND CISCO. I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK I COULD HAVE DONE MORE FOR 8-BALL. CISCO, THIS DRINK IS FOR YOU, PERHAPS I WILL SETTLE DOWN IN YOUR BELOVED COLUMBIA. TO THE REST, TO HELL WITH YOU AND HERE'S TO NEVER LOOKING BACK...
HELLO, MIKE-SAN. YOU'VE BEHAVED ABOVE NORMAL MALE ABILITY, HAVEN'T YOU? I WANT YOU TO PLAY MEAN WITH A NAUGHTY CASINO OWNER WHO HASN'T BEEN PAYING HIS PROTECTION MONEY. EITHER GET THE MONEY OR LIGHT UP HIS PLACE.

HEY MIKE, YOU DRIVE. I GOTTA GET MY HEAD TOGETHER FOR THIS MEETING WITH THE MAFIA.
HEY MON! YOU'RE DOING ME A GREAT INJUSTICE. YOU COME BLAZING IN HERE WITHOUT ANY REASON.
HEY TOUGH GUY! YOU THINK YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH THE SLAUGHTER YOU JUST CAUSED?

HEY, MIKE. THANKS FOR COMIN'. I GOT A REAL PROBLEM THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. THEY'RE PUTTIN' UP A THREE-LEVEL DISCO CALLED DIAMOND SKY AND THE GRAND OPENING IS TOMORROW NIGHT. IT'S GOING TO ATTRACT THE WRONG TYPE OF CLIENTELE TO THE AREA, WHICH IS BAD FOR MY BUSINESS.
HEY, MIKE. THIS IS 8-BALL. NO TIME TO EXPLAIN NOW BUT GET YOUR BUTT OVER TO AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN PIKE CREEK. I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU.
HEY, MISTER! YOU MADE ME SPILL MY COFFEE ALL OVER MY DONUTS! I'D WRITE YOU A TICKET BUT I'VE ALREADY MET MY QUOTA FOR THE WEEK...
HEY, MY MAN. TAKE A BANSHEE AND HIT THAT RAMP! WATCH YOUR SPEED - YOU ONLY HAVE TO GET TO THE TWENTY YARD LINE.
HEY, WISE GUY, I SAID GET THE CAR PAINTED, NOT TURN IT INTO A HEAP OF METAL.
HEY, YOU TRUST ME RIGHT? I'VE GOT INFORMATION THEY NEED. SUPPORT ME ON THIS, AND WE'LL BE A WHOLE LOT RICHER AND OFF THIS STINKIN' ISLAND IN NO TIME.
HEY, YOU'RE QUICK WITH THE STICK. NICE GOING!
HEY,MIKE. PEOPLE 'ROUND HERE CALL ME SLICK... PROBABLY 'CAUSE I'M COVERED IN GREASE MOST TIMES. 8-BALL TOLD ME HE'S IN A BIT OF A JAM AND IS KEEPING A LOW PROFILE. DON'T ASK ME ABOUT THE DETAILS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW BUT HE SAID HE'D CONTACT YOU.
HI YUKA. I HOPE THEY'VE BEEN TREATING YOU OKAY. WE'RE NOT IN THE CLEAR YET. HOLD ON AND I'LL SEE YOU GET BACK TO YOUR AUNT'S PLACE SAFELY.

HOW MUCH SIMPLER COULD I MAKE THE JOB FOR YOU? DOUCHE BAG...
HOW NICE. YOU GET TO SPEND SOME QUALITY TIME WITH THE BOYS IN THE PEN.
HOW PERCEPTIVE OF YOU, PERHAPS YOU'RE NOT AS DUMB AS HE LED ME TO BELIEVE. AS FAR AS HIS IDENTITY, WELL, HE DIDN'T SAY. PERHAPS YOU'LL FIND OUT AFTER WE SEND YOU TO HELL. GET HIM BOYS!
HOW RUDE YOU ARE, AMIGO. I HAVE NO TIME TO DISCIPLINE YOU UNFORTUNATELY. YUKA WILL BE OUT OF SCHOOL SHORTLY AND WAITING FOR HER LIMO.
HOW WILL I RECOGNIZE THEM?
HOW'D YOU LIKE THOSE LEATHER SEATS. PLENTY OF ROOM IN THE BACK FOR YOU PLAYA', EH?

HURRY BACK TO THE BAR WITH THE STUFF.
I AIN'T GONNA WORK FOR YOU, PIMP. GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME! HELP! HELP!
I AM A PROUD, ILLEGAL ALIEN AND I HAVE AN IDENTITY CARD PROVIDED BY THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT TO PROVE IT. IT MAKES LITTLE DIFFERENCE THAT I'M COLUMBIAN, ANOTHER FACT TO BE PROUD OF. BACK TO BUSINESS. I'LL PROVIDE YOU A MAP OF THE ROUTE I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE WHILE I, OF COURSE, TAKE A MUCH SAFER ONE. STAY IN THE CAR TO KEEP THE DISGUISE UP! GOOD LUCK, AMIGO.
I CAME HERE TO BECOME A STAR, NOW LOOK AT ME, MIKE! WE COULDA' BEEN GOOD TOGETHER.
I CAN SEE THE BLAZE FROM HERE, K-KUN. NOT EXACTLY WHAT I HAD IN MIND FOR YOUR PRISONERS' FATE. BAKA!
I CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM FOR YOU. ANY WORD ON THE KILLER? HE TOOK MY PARTNER VINNIE OUT TOO.
I CAN'T AFFORD TO BURY YOU, KIDDO.
I CAN'T BE HAVIN' YOU DRIVE LIKE A MANIAC FOR ME. WHAT WOULD DI NEIGHBORS BE SAYIN',MON?
I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS. GOTTA' CONCENTRATE AND THINK MEAN, VIOLENT THOUGHTS. OKAY BOMBER, I'M COMING FOR YOU NOW.
I CAN'T HANDLE THESE GUYS. I'M BETTER OFF IN A WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM.
I CAN'T HAVE A WANTED MAN WORKING FOR ME.
I CAN'T HAVE YOU DRIVING LIKE A MANIAC FOR ME. WHAT WOULD THE NEIGHBORS SAY, MON?
I CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE, ASUKA. I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU TO YOUR TOYS AND KEEP MY SKIN INTACT. SEE YOU.
I CAN'T WORK FOR THIS MAD WOMAN ANYMORE. SHE'S GOING TO GET ME KILLED. TIME TO DRIVE THE TRUCK OVER TO THE DOCKS AND INTRODUCE THESE MAFIA THUGS TO THEIR NEW LIVES.
I COULD USE SOME TIME OFF OF MY FEET. YOU WANT A QUICKIE, HONEY?
I DIDN'T KNOW IT'D BE SUICIDE TO LET YOU DRIVE.
I DIDN'T QUITE FOLLOW ALL THAT, CISCO, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT INTENTIONS. IF THERE ARE ANY FUZZY DICE I'M THROWING THEM OUT BEFORE I GET STARTED.
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAVE SUCH A HARD STREAK IN YOU, ASUKA.
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D LET A FEW HOODS GET THE BEST OF YOU, KID.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT, MON! YOU'RE THE FASTEST DRIVER EVER. LIVING LIFE IN THE FAST LANE, YOU'RE KEEPING EVERYBODY HIGH WITH HAPPINESS!
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU AND NEITHER DO MY MEN. PREPARE TO DIE!
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR THE PATIENCE. GET MOVING BEFORE HE MAKES IT HOME.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT WHAT CISCO OWES YOU, BUT I DO KNOW THAT IF YOU DON'T DO WHAT HE SAYS, YOU'LL END UP DEAD IN A GUTTER.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF FETISH YOU'VE GOT FOR FISH BUT MY PATIENCE IS ALL GONE.
I DON'T MISTAKE PAIN FOR PLEASURE, ASUKA. I'M OFF TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF MY LABOR.
I DON'T MIX BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE, ASUKA. PERHAPS WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH MY SERVICES.
I DON'T PUT MUCH FAITH IN YOUR WORDS. YOU'RE ALL BACK-STABBING LIARS.
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT ME, MIKE-SAN. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
I DON'T TAKE REJECTION VERY WELL BUT I SUPPOSE I SHOULD THANK YOU FOR THE RIDE.
I DON'T THINK ASUKA WILL MISS THIS MONEY MUCH ESPECIALLY IF I RESCUE HER NIECE.
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW, SO I WON'T EVEN ASK. HERE'S A CRATE OF DAY-OLD ORGANIC MEAT THAT WENT BAD ON ME.
I FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO WITH VINNIE, MIKE. COME ON BACK. - 8-BALL
I GOT ANOTHER JOB FOR YOU. I AM LATE WITH A SHIPMENT OF SUPPLIES AND THERE'S A VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER OUT THERE. DO ME A FAVOR AND DELIVER THESE GOODS TO HIM. JUST BE CAREFUL - THIS STUFF IS PRETTY VOLATILE. THE CAR OUT BACK IS ALL PACKED AND READY TO GO.
I GOT IT. BUT TELL ME, HOW DOES THIS HELP MY SITUATION?
I GOTTA LET THIS GUY GO AND TAKE MY CHANCES OVER WHETHER HE'LL KEEP HIS WORD OR NOT. I CAN'T HAVE THE YARDIES AND THE YARDIES AFTER ME AT THE SAME TIME. DAMN, NOW I GOT TO DEAL WITH KING COURTNEY.
I GOTTA LET THIS GUY GO AND TAKE MY CHANCES OVER WHETHER HE'LL KEEP HIS WORD. I CAN'T HAVE THE YARDIES AND THE CARTEL AFTER ME AT THE SAME TIME. DAMN, NOW I GOT TO DEAL WITH KING COURTNEY.
I HADN'T REALIZED YOU WERE SUCH A CONCERNED CITIZEN, CISCO. OR THAT YOU WERE EVEN A CITIZEN.
I HAVEN'T COME THIS FAR TO FALL AT THE HANDS OF KING COURTNEY. TELL ASUKA SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE COUNTED ME OUT.
I HEARD ALL ABOUT IT OVER THE LOCAL NEWS! HERE'S THE MONEY FOR ASUKA AND SOME FOR YOU FOR HELPING ME OUT.
I HEARD YOU MADE A LOT OF DOUGH WITH MARKED CARDS. I'LL TAKE IT EASY ON YOU IF YOU GIVE ME TEN THOUSAND.
I HOPE YOU CAN HANDLE SOME COMPETITION 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GETTIN' HERE. YOU'VE GOT SOME COMPETITION THAT'S GOING TO TRY TO RUN YOU OFF THE ROAD AND MAKE SURE YOU FAIL THE RACE. YOU'RE BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A YAKUZA; YOU'VE GOT TWO AND A HALF MINUTES TO COMPLETE THE RACE.
I HOPE YOU CAN HANDLE SOME COMPETITION 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GETTIN' HERE. YOU'VE GOT SOME COMPETITION THAT'S GOING TO TRY TO RUN YOU OFF THE ROAD AND MAKE SURE YOU FAIL THE RACE. YOU'RE BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A YAKUZA; YOU'VE GOT TWO MINUTES TO COMPLETE THE RACE.
I HOPE YOU LIKE BIG CARS 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE RACIN'. YOU GOT THREE MINUTES TO CRUISE 'ROUND THE CITY IN THIS ESPERANTO.
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I CAN WAIT THAT LONG FOR YOU, BABY.
I KNEW I COULD COUNT ON YOU. WE DON'T OWE NOBODY NOTHING AND THE POLICE AREN'T ON TO US. IT'S TIME TO MAKE A NEW START.
I NEED 10 SPECIFIC CARS FOR THIS JOB. DROP THEM OFF HERE.
I NEED TO KNOW WHERE KING COURTNEY IS HIDING OUT AND HOW MANY MEN HE HAS.
I NEED YOU IN THE GAME, KIDDO. IN THE GAME!
I NEED YOU TO GO AROUND THE CITY, PICK THEM UP AND TAKE THEM TO THE CLUB.
I NEED YOU TO RUN THIS GUY OFF THE ROAD, AND GET THE CAR BACK HERE PRONTO.
I NEVER REALIZED YOU COULD BE SUCH A PUTZ, KID.
I RAN OUT OF GRAIN SO I USED SOME DRAINER FLUID. JUST A BIT, MIND YOU. TOO MUCH AND IT WILL SEND THE CUSTOMERS TO THE BATHROOMS - PERMANENTLY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE PUT MY FAITH IN A GAIJIN.
I SHUDDER AT THE THOUGHT. LET ONE OF YOUR GOONS TAKE CARE OF THAT BUSINESS.
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT JUST HAPPENED. WHAT THE HELL AM I GOING TO DO NOW? VINNIE HAD ALL OUR MONEY.
I STILL DON'T SEE WHAT SNACKS, GIRLS, AND KARAOKE HAVE TO DO WITH EACH OTHER BUT WHATEVER. VERY WELL I'LL DO THIS BUT IT'S THE LAST JOB I DO FOR YOU, ASUKA. AFTER THIS, I'M GOING MY OWN WAY.
I TAKE IT YOU ONLY WANT ME TO INJURE THE QUARTERBACK AND NOT KILL HIM, RIGHT?
I THINK SHE LIKED HOW YOU HANDLED HER, SMOOTH RIDER.
I TOLD YOU TO GET IT SPRAYED FIRST! ARE YOU DEAF OR SOMETHING?
I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE THE GETAWAY CAR AT THE HIDEOUT. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
I WANT TO FIND THE BASTARDS AS MUCH AS YOU DO. WHATEVER MONEY THE BARTENDER HAD WAS STOLEN. THAT'S MY MONEY AND I WANT IT BACK. DO SOME FAVORS FOR ME AND I'LL HELP YOU TRACK DOWN THE MURDERER. I HAVE A PRIME OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU. MY NORMAL DRIVER HAS A BULLET HOLE IN HIS HEAD - JUST BEFORE THE MOST IMPORTANT RACE OF THE SEASON, MON! IT'S AGAINST THE YAKUZA - THE DRIVER'S A BIT CRAZY AND MAY TRY TO RAM YOU. THE RACE HAPPENS ON THE WALK-TO-WORK DAY SO THERE WON'T BE MUCH TRAFFIC AROUND. IF YOU DO WELL, WE'LL SHUT THE CITY DOWN AND LET YOU DRIVE A REAL FORMULA ONE RACING CAR!
I WARNED YOU TO STAY IN THE CAR, AMIGO. IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE, YOU ARE NOT COLUMBIAN AND DO NOT LOOK LIKE ME. I WILL KILL YOU.
I WAS HOPIN' 8-BALL WOULD SEND SOMEONE WITH MORE CLASS AND A BETTER LOOKIN' CAR.
I WAS IN THE GAME TOO LONG, MIKE. ANY MORALS I HAD DIED A LONG TIME AGO. YOU'RE JUST A DUMB, GULLIBLE KID. I DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE THE MONEY WITH YOU, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.... GOODBYE, MIKE.
I WON'T LIE TO YOU, MIKE. MY MEN GOT CAUGHT IN TRAFFIC IS ALL. URBAN SPRAWL, MON, AND YOU PICK RUSH HOUR TO START YOUR RAID? NEVER MIND, I'VE GOT A BETTER PLAN. CISCO'S BEEN SPOTTED AT A RESTAURANT NEARBY AND YOU CAN HAVE YOUR REVENGE. BOX HIS FACE INTO A BLOODY MESS WITH YOUR BARE HANDS! HE HAS SOME BODYGUARDS OUT FRONT SO LOOK FOR ANOTHER WAY IN.
I'D BETTER LOAD UP ON AMMUNITION BEFORE I TAKE ON THE YARDIES.
I'D BETTER TAKE THE MONEY AND HEAD BACK TO THE BAR. I SMELL AN AMBUSH.
I'D BETTER TRACK DOWN THAT CAR THAT GOT AWAY. WHOEVER IS BEHIND THIS HAS GOT A LOT TO ANSWER FOR.
I'D RATHER GET THIS FISH SMELL OFF OF ME, ASUKA. I'LL BE SEEING YOU.
I'D RATHER NOT. WHAT INTERESTS ME IS HEARING MORE ABOUT LEADS YOU HAVE TO THE ASSASSIN'S IDENTITY.
I'LL BE DEAD BEFORE I LET HER REMINISCE ABOUT ME LIKE THAT... EH, YEAH.
I'LL GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT. BETTER HAVE THE MONEY READY WHEN I GET BACK.
I'LL KEEP THIS SIMPLE TO KEEP YOUR HEAD FROM HURTING, AMIGO. THERE IS A FACTORY THAT IS MANUFACTURING AERIAL SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT FOR SOUTH AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS. YOU HAVE SOME CONTACTS IN THE EXPLOSIVES BUSINESS, YES? BLOW UP THE FACILITY AND I WILL REWARD YOU HANDSOMELY. YOU NEED TO TRACK DOWN A TECHNICIAN WHO WORKS THERE TO GET AN ID CARD TO AVOID SUSPICION. PLEASE BE MINDFUL OF THE SURROUNDING AREA; THERE ARE SEVERAL BOUTIQUES I VISIT AND I'D BE ANGRY IF THEY WERE DAMAGED.
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU SOMEDAY, 8-BALL. I PROMISE! 
I'LL NOT BE INTIMIDATED! SERGEANT, ARREST THIS MAN!
I'LL SAY THIS: THEY MANAGED TO FRIGHTEN A FEW CIVILIANS AND NOT RUN AWAY. THANKS FOR THE HELP. WHAT BRINGS YOU TO SHORESIDE, CISCO?
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. CONSIDER THEM BURIED.
I'LL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR LIFE NOW, SCUM. YOU'RE NOTHING TO ME. GOODBYE, VINNIE.
I'LL TRY. SAY HI TO YUKA FOR ME.
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE ONE STEP BEHIND THE BOSS, MIKE. HE'S TAKING CARE OF A LITTLE BUSINESS WITH A COLUMBIAN WHO'S BEEN GIVING HIM HEADACHES. I THINK YOU KNOW THE ONE - CISCO'S HIS NAME?
I'M COMING FOR YOU, VINNIE.
I'M CURIOUS, WHAT'S THE FASCINATION WITH BLOWFISH?
I'M GOING OUT FOR A SMOKE! NO, I DON'T NEED YOU WATCHING ME LIKE I'M A BABY! WELL... HELLO THERE, AMIGO, MAY I PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME ASSISTANCE?
I'M GOING TO AUTOGRAPH YOUR FACE WITH MY KNUCKLES, JOCKSTRAP.
I'M HERE ON TIME. WHERE THE HELL IS VINNIE?
I'M IN A GOOD MOOD TODAY SO I'LL OFFER YOU A DEAL. TELL ME WHO YOUR BOSS IS AND WHAT HE WANTS, AND I'LL LET YOU LIVE.
I'M NOT CUT OUT FOR POLITICS. I DON'T BACKSTAB ENEMIES, I GET IN THEIR FACE.
I'M NOT HERE TO PLAY GAMES, GUY. ASUKA SENT ME TO COLLECT THE MONEY YOU OWE HER.
I'M NOT SORRY HE'S DEAD, I JUST DON'T TRUST THESE PEOPLE, VINNIE. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS.
I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT BUT I'LL DO IT ON ONE CONDITION. I'M TRACKING DOWN THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR MY PARTNER VINNIE'S DEATH AND I NEED ANY INFORMATION YOU CAN GET ABOUT SLIME BAGS WHO SPECIALIZE IN MAKING BOMBS.
I'M NOT USED TO GUYS AS YOUNG AS YOU, SWEETY. US WOMEN ONLY GET BETTER WITH AGE.
I'M PUTTING YOU DOWN FOR GOOD.
I'M SENDING YOU TO THE OTHER SIDE, MON.
I'M SORRY SIR, YOU MUST HAVE WHITE GLOVES IN ORDER TO PLAY THE PACHINKO MACHINES.
I'M SURPRISED NO ONE'S GONE BLIND ON THE CRAP YOU SERVE.
I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS.
I'VE GOT A MISSION FOR YOU. HEAD TO THE BAR. - JONNIE
I'VE GOT MYSELF SOME HOT ACTION, BUT I CAN'T BE SEEN WITH HER OR HER DAD WILL KILL ME. NOW SHE'S DRUNK AND NEEDS TO GET HOME. MAKE SURE SHE GETS BACK SAFE.
I'VE GOT NO ONE ELSE TO TURN TO BUT I WARN YOU, DON'T DOUBLE-CROSS ME. YOU DON'T WANT ME COMING AFTER YOU.
I'VE GOT SOME ANNOYANCES THAT NEED TAKING CARE OF. SOME LOWLIFES OWE ME MONEY AND THEIR TIME IS UP. PAY 'EM A VISIT AND MAKE SURE IT'S PERMANENT.
I'VE GOT YOUR BACK, VINNIE. YOU GOT ME OFF THE STREETS AND BACK ON MY FEET.
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY GROWN MEN CRY. TIME TO DROP THEM OFF.
IDAHO
IF I TAKE OUT THE NEW CARTEL BOSS, I CAN GET THE REST OF THESE GOONS OFF MY BACK. LET'S SEE IF I CAN'T SQUEEZE SOME INFORMATION OUT OF THIS ABOUT WHO ELSE MIGHT BE AFTER ME. IT'S TIME FOR MAJOR ROAD RAGE.
IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT I LEARNED FROM VINNIE IS THAT MERCY IS FOR THOSE THAT CAN AFFORD IT AND I CAN'T. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY I'M GETTING OUT OF THIS CITY AND THAT'S IF I TAKE OUT ALL MY ENEMIES.
IF WE WERE IN NEVADA, THIS CRAP WOULD BE LEGAL.... WHAT THE HELL? DAMN, PIMP, LEAVE ME ALONE!
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THIS LINE OF BUSINESS, KID, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.
IF YOU DO THIS FOR ME, YOU WILL BE REWARDED BEYOND YOUR DARKEST FANTASIES.
IF YOU WEREN'T 8-BALL'S FRIEND, I'D NEVER GET IN A CAR LIKE THIS.
IF YOU WEREN'T SO CUTE, I WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN IN A RIDE LIKE THIS, SWEETY.
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN EARNING MONEY BETWEEN MISSIONS, TRY @8STREET RACING@0. HEAD OVER TO THE CHECKERED FLAG ON THE RADAR TO GET IN ON THE ACTION.

IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE FACTS ARE, IT'S WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVE, MAN. NOW YOU'RE ON TOP OF THEIR LIST, AND GANGS LIKE THE CARTEL, AND THE... WHAT THE HELL'S THAT NOISE?
IT IS OF NO CONCERN TO YOU, AMIGO. SHE WILL PROVE USEFUL FOR BLACKMAILING ASUKA, OF THAT I HAVE NO DOUBT.
IT WASN'T ME! WHEN I CAME BACK TO THE SCENE, HE WAS ALREADY DEAD.
IT'LL BE SAFE TO WALK THE STREETS AGAIN WHEN I'M DONE. BACK TO THE FREIGHTER.
IT'S A DAMN SHAME, I TELL 'EM. I LIKED THAT KID.
IT'S A LONG BOMB, BABY! TAKE A BANSHEE AND JUMP TO THE OPPONENT'S TWENTY YARD LINE. STRUT YOUR STUFF.
IT'S A PITY HE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO REASON AND YOU HAD TO TORCH THE PLACE. HOWEVER, IT SENDS A CAUTIONARY MESSAGE TO THE REST WHO ARE UNDER MY PROTECTION. THANK YOU, MIKE-SAN!
IT'S ALMOST HAPPY HOUR, MIKE. HURRY ON BACK. - JONNIE
IT'S CALLED RACING, NOT DEMOLITION, MON! DON'T DO ME ANY FAVORS. YOU'VE GOT TWO LEFT FEET...
IT'S FINE BY ME IF YOU STAY QUIET. I JUST NEED THAT ID CLIPPED TO YOUR SHIRT.
IT'S GETTING CROWDED DOWN BELOW. DON'T BRING ANY MORE FAT ONES.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO, CISCO. NOT A BAD PLACE YOU'VE GOT HERE. WHY THE CHANGE IN LOCATION?
IT'S HARD TO STAY COOL WHEN I'VE GOT A SCORE TO SETTLE, 8-BALL. WHOEVER IS BEHIND VINNIE'S DEATH MADE A FATAL MISTAKE BY NOT TAKING ME OUT WITH HIM.
IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM UNLESS I GET CAUGHT. NOW GET GOING.
IT'S PRETTY HARD TO MISS THESE LADIES, TRUST ME.
IT'S SIMPLE REALLY. JUST MAKE SURE YOUR ANTI-SMOKING BILL ISN'T PUT TO A VOTE... EVER.
IT'S STRANGE, THEY MADE IT SOUND LIKE THIS ASSASSIN KNEW WHO I WAS. I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, CISCO.
IT'S THE CARTEL, MIKE-SAN. SOMEHOW THEY GOT TIPPED YOU'RE ON TO THEM. GET IN THERE FAST AND RESCUE YUKA! - ASUKA

KING COURTNEY IS IN A WALLED COMPOUND NORTHWEST OF HERE. ASUKA GAVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE WERE TWO WAYS TO ENTER IT: A FRONTAL ASSAULT THROUGH THE GATES OR A BACK ENTRANCE. ASUKA WILL SEND A FEW MEN TO HELP. ELIMINATE KING COURTNEY!
KING COURTNEY SEEMS TO FEAR YOU BUT YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE MUCH TO ME, CISCO. WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME A BIT ABOUT MY PARTNER VINNIE AND THE BARTENDER?
KING COURTNEY'S UP TO HIS OLD TRICKS, HUH? YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.
KING, I'M NOT HERE TO LISTEN TO ANY OF YOUR LIES. I KNOW YOU'VE SENT MEN TO KILL ME. NOW THE TABLES ARE TURNED AND YOU'RE GOING OUT IN A BODY BAG.
KING, THIS IS THE LAST MISSION I DO FOR YOU. CISCO HAD BETTER BE THE ONE OR NEXT TIME WE MEET, I'LL BE BEHIND A BARREL OF A SHOTGUN.

LET'S JUST SAY I OWE KING COURTNEY OVER ON STAUNTON SEVERAL GRAND FOR PARTY FAVORS. HIS YARDIES HAVE BEEN HOUNDING ME RECENTLY.
LET'S JUST SAY I'M A CONCERNED CITIZEN WHO WANTS TO PROTECT HIS RIGHT TO SMOKE.
LET'S JUST SAY THAT HE'S INDISPOSED... INDEFINITELY. READY TO TAKE A RIDE? WE CAN DO THIS THE NICE WAY OR THE NOT-SO-NICE WAY. STAY DOWN, KEEP QUIET, AND BE A GOOD GIRL AND YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT. OTHERWISE, I TAPE YOU UP AND USE A GAG.

MIKE! LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS! I'LL SPLIT THE MONEY WITH YOU. PLEASE!! YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE THE HEART TO TAKE ME OUT.
MIKE, CALL ME PARANOID BUT I'VE BEEN SEEING SOME SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS DRIVING BY HERE AND I DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF 'EM. LUCKILY, I HAVE A SOLUTION. THERE'S SOME ILLEGAL CARGO AT THE DOCKS GUARDED BY SOME WEAPON SMUGGLERS. IF MY INFORMANTS ARE RIGHT, THE CARGO CONTAINS A ROCKET LAUNCHER. NOW, HERE'S WHERE YOU COME IN. TAKE OUT THE SMUGGLERS AT THE DOCKS, SECURE THE ROCKET LAUNCHER, AND BRING IT BACK TO ME. DON'T USE IT EITHER - I NEED ALL THE AMMO.
MIKE, DON'T DO THIS! YOU TAKE ME OUT AND EVERY TWO-BIT THUG WITH AN EYE FOR QUICK CASH WILL STILL COME AFTER YOU! YOU THINK YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH MY MONEY? YOU'LL BE DEAD BEFORE YOU REACH THE CITY LIMITS.
MIKE, I HAVE MYSELF A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS LOOKING INTO. THOSE CARTEL BASTARDS ARE TRYING TO TAKE OVER MY DELIVERY ROUTES. THEY WANT TO RUIN MY LIVELIHOOD!
MIKE, I'M IN NEED OF SOME SERIOUS FIREPOWER. COME TO THE BAR. - JONNIE
MIKE, I'VE GOT SOME STUFF THAT NEEDS COLLECTING. IT'S WHAT I CALL MY 'SPECIAL' BREW. TAKE THE MONSTER TRUCK OUT FRONT AND BRING IT ALL BACK. I NEED IT FAST, SO HURRY.
MIKE, I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE - DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SEE. I'M IMPRESSED WITH YOU, I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO SEE YOU UP CLOSE ONE LAST TIME.
MIKE, IT'S PAYBACK TIME. GET ON BACK HERE. - VINNIE
MIKE, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING OF MY BUSINESS. YOU'RE IGNORANT OR EVEN STUPID PERHAPS, AMIGO, SO I WILL SPEAK SLOWLY AND SIMPLY. I'M INVOLVED IN THE AIRLINE BUSINESS; I LOVE TO TRAVEL AND SIT IN THE LEATHER CHAIRS OF FIRST CLASS SIPPING MARTINIS AND LOOKING AT THE LOVELY LADIES. BUT WHERE WAS I? OH YES, TRAVEL. DUE TO THE TIGHTER AIRLINE REGULATIONS AND METAL DETECTORS, I'VE BEGUN A BUSINESS OF DESIGNING SHOES WITH HEELS THAT CONTAIN NO METAL AND HAVE A VERY COMFORTABLE AIR POCKET IN THE MIDDLE.
MIKE, MI AMIGO, IT HAS BEEN TOO LONG. REGRETTABLY, I SEE THAT TIME HAS DONE NOTHING TO IMPROVE YOUR MANNERS OR YOUR SENSE OF FASHION. WHERE WAS I? OH YES, A TRAP. IT SEEMS THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WANT TO SEE YOU DEAD.
MIKE, STAY AWAY FROM YOUR @8HIDEOUT@0, THE COPS ARE LOOKING FOR YOU. COME TO MY PAD IN PORTLAND BEACH BUT LOSE THE COPS FIRST! - 8-BALL
MIKE, WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. GET ON BACK HERE! - KING

MIKE-SAN, BE A GOOD BOY AND LISTEN. I'VE LUSTED FOR YOU FROM THE MOMENT I SAW YOU. COME TO ME IN MY BEDCHAMBER.... UNLESS, THAT IS, YOU'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO THE OPPOSITE SEX?
MIKE-SAN, BETTER OUTRUN THE COPS FOR A WHILE. ATO DE - ASUKA.
MIKE-SAN, COME SEE ME UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL. DO YOU LIKE SPORTS? I HAVE A MISSION FOR YOU. - ASUKA
MIKE-SAN, COME TO ME QUICKLY! MAN KNOWS NO WRATH LIKE A WOMAN SCORNED! - ASUKA.
MIKE-SAN, DO YOU SMELL THAT ODOR? THAT'S THE SMELL OF ROTTEN BLOWFISH AND SOMEONE'S BEEN DELIVERING IT TO MY CHAIN OF SUE-ME SUSHI RESTAURANTS. I WANT YOU TO TRACK DOWN THE CULPRIT AND BRING HIM BACK HERE. MAKE SURE YOU BRING HIS TRUCK WITH THE EVIDENCE BACK HERE; I CAN USE IT AGAINST THE FISHERMEN'S UNION. BE QUICK ABOUT IT, I CAN'T AFFORD THE LAWSUITS THAT ARE PILING UP.
MIKE-SAN, I FIND MYSELF GROWING FONDER FOR YOU MINUTE BY MINUTE. I'VE GROWN ATTACHED TO YOU AND WANT YOU FOR ALL MY BLOODY MISSIONS. AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE MY HANDS INVOLVED IN GAMBLING AND ONE IMPORTANT AREA IS SPORTS. NOW THE VICE CITY MAMBAS ARE COMING INTO TOWN AND OUR HOMETOWN FAVORITES - THE LIBERTY CITY COCKS - ARE THE HEAVY UNDERDOGS. IF VICE'S QUARTERBACK WERE TO SUFFER A BROKEN ARM, I COULD STAND TO GAIN A LOT FROM THE EARLY BETTING.
MIKE-SAN, I GOT A FISHY PROBLEM. COME SOON! - ASUKA.
MIKE-SAN, I HAVE THE INFORMATION YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. IT'S ABOUT THE BOMBER WHO HAD DEALINGS WITH YOUR PARTNER VINNIE. THERE IS, HOWEVER, ONE THING YOU MUST DO BEFORE I GIVE YOU THIS INFORMATION. THERE'S A PIMP IN TOWN WHO'S BEEN STALKING MY WORKING GIRLS AND CAUSING HAVOC TO MY HOSTESS BUSINESS. TAKE HIM OUT AND THEN REPORT BACK HERE FOR THE INFORMATION I PROMISED.
MIKE-SAN, I'M QUITE UPSET. I RUN A PROFITABLE IMPORT-EXPORT BUSINESS AND THE MAFIA SEEMS TO WANT A PIECE OF MY PIE, SO TO SPEAK.
MIKE-SAN, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. YOU'VE MADE QUITE A FEW ENEMIES SINCE LAST WE MET AND THERE'S ONE IN PARTICULAR I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU WITH. KING COURTNEY IS PUSHING HIS GANG INTO MY AREA AND I WANT HIM ELIMINATED. I'M PREPARED TO ASSIST YOU.
MIKE-SAN, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO THE PLEASURES OF THE SNACK BAR. - ASUKA.
MIKE-SAN, MY KATANA LOOKS LIKE IT'S HAD QUITE A WORKOUT! LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE BROUGHT ME. UNBELIEVABLE! I COUNT %8 MEN HERE! THE MAFIA WILL BE SORE PRESSED TO RECOVER FROM SUCH A BLOW. I WILL TRIPLE YOUR PAY AND YOU MAY KEEP MY KATANA AND CAR!
MIKE-SAN, NICELY DONE! THE POLICE REPORT SAYS THEY REPORTED IT AS A RESULT OF PRACTICING WITHOUT PADS. THEY MUST HAVE BEEN EMBARRASSED TO HAVE BEEN BEATEN BY A LONE GUY. GO COCKS!
MIKE-SAN, SUCH TRAGEDY MAKES ME ACHE INSIDE. I'LL PUT MY MEN ON IT RIGHT AWAY. NOW, BACK TO THE BUSINESS AT HAND. THERE'S A DROP OFF SPOT FOR THE INITIAL SUM OF TWENTY THOUSAND. TAKE THIS BRIEFCASE, MAKE THE DELIVERY, AND THEN SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT YUKA.
MIKE-SAN, WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF THE IMPORT-EXPORT BUSINESS? COME SEE ME. - ASUKA.
MIKE-SAN, YOU WOULDN'T DARE SPURN MY WOMANLY ADVANCES, WOULD YOU? WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT BIFF ROCK, THE MOVIE STAR, DID TO ME! I DON'T TAKE KINDLY TO REJECTIONS. I WANT HIM DEAD!
MIKE-SAN, YOU'RE AMAZING! YOU'VE BROUGHT THAT BASTARD BACK TO ME ALIVE AND IN ONE PIECE!
MIKE-SAN, YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL. I HOPE IT WASN'T TOO DIFFICULT? NEXT TIME DON'T BE SO NICE THOUGH. I WANT YOU TO TAKE FIRMER ACTIONS. YES, FIRM...
MIKE-SAN, YOU'VE SATISFIED EVERY DESIRE I'VE ASKED OF YOU. I HAVE ONE LAST REQUEST BEFORE YOU LEAVE ME, PERHAPS FOREVER.

MY AUNT'S MEN ARE RIGHT BEHIND US, MISTER. I THINK YOU'RE NOT SO BAD BUT THEY'LL KILL YOU EVEN SO.
MY DEAR MIKE-SAN, WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN THE SHEETS AND IN THE REAL WORLD ARE TWO DIFFERENT MATTERS. IN BOTH CASES, YOU ARE A MEANS TO AN END. GOODBYE, MIKE-SAN.

I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU AND IF MY SOURCES ARE CORRECT, YOU'RE THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB I HAVE. MY NIECE HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED AND HER ABDUCTORS HAVE DEMANDED AN OUTRAGEOUS FEE.

OK, NOT THE BEST DRIVING BUT YOU MADE IT
OKAY MIKE, I JUST NEED TO GRAB THE MONEY AND WE'RE READY TO GO. MEET ME AT THE BRIDGE IN FIVE MINUTES IN THE GETAWAY CAR, AND WE'LL GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE FOR GOOD.
OKAY MIKE. THE MAFIA IS READY TO HELP US GET OUT OF THE CITY, BUT WE'RE GOING TO NEED A CAR - A FAST ONE. HEAD OVER TO ATLANTIC QUAYS - THERE'S A BANSHEE SITTING IN THE LOT JUST WAITING TO BE TAKEN. GRAB IT, GET IT SPRAY PAINTED, THEN DROP IT OFF AT THE HIDEOUT. ONCE YOU'VE DONE THIS, COME BACK HERE AND WE'LL WORK ON GETTING THE MONEY READY FOR TRANSPORT.
OKAY, GANGSTA. THIS IS EARLY MORNING STREET RACING, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU'VE GOT THREE AND A HALF MINUTES TO GET AROUND THE COURSE IN A BF INJECTION. GETTING OUT OF THE CAR FAILS THE MISSION.
OKAY, LOCO! THAT KING COURTNEY SPEAKS NOTHING BUT LIES! WHAT THE HELL WOULD I WANT WITH THIS BARTENDER OR THIS PARTNER OF YOURS?
OKAY, MIKE. I HAVE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. IT'S CISCO, THE HEAD OF THE CARTEL - A BAD CHARACTER. HE SET YOUR PARTNER VINNIE UP AND TOOK THE BARTENDER DOWN. HE'S GOT A BIG MEETING GOING ON AND YOU CAN MAKE A MAJOR BLOW TO HIS OPERATIONS. I'LL SEND YOU A FEW MEN TO BACK YOU UP. ALL MY TROUBLES - AND YOURS TOO, MON - WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF.
OKAY, MIKE. THE MAFIA DOESN'T LIKE TO BE DISRESPECTED. THEY WANT YOU TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF SOME HOODS IN TRENTON.
OKAY, MISTER, YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO DO DOWN AT THE STATION. YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.
OKAY, THAT'S TWO SO FAR.  HERE'S WHERE TWO MORE ARE.

TELL ME WHY I DON'T JUST SHOOT YOU NOW. YOU'RE THE GOON WHO TOOK OUT A FRIEND OF MINE - THE BARTENDER. I TRACKED YOU HERE ALL THE WAY FROM PORTLAND.
TELL ME WHY, VINNIE! WHY'D YOU BETRAY ME? I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING FOR YOU!
THANKS A LOT, YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB.
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP, 8-BALL. YOU HELPED ME OUT OF A TIGHT SPOT, LET ME KNOW IF I CAN RETURN THE FAVOR.
THANKS MIKE. THAT WAS GETTING TO BE A THORN IN MY SIDE.
THANKS, 8-BALL. I'LL BE SEEING YOU AROUND.
THANKS, HOPEFULLY THEY'RE NOT AFTER ME.
THANKS, THE NEW OWNER WILL APPRECIATE THIS.
THANKS. COME BACK LATER ONCE I'VE GOT A HANDLE ON THINGS.
THAT DID THE TRICK. I'D BETTER CHECK ON YUKA AND THEN DRIVE THIS BUS OUT OF HERE.
THAT ONE'S BUSTED UP, MIKE. YOU'VE GOT TO DROP OFF DIABLOS IN PERFECT CONDITION.
THAT ONE'S CALLED THE MONEY SHOT.
THAT ONLY LEAVES ONE SUSPECT. I HOPE HE'S THE CULPRIT, I'M SICK OF MUCKIN' AROUND IN THESE BLASTED FISH TRUCKS!
THAT SHE-DEVIL! SHE'S WRINGING ME DRY! I CAN'T AFFORD HER AND THE COPS THAT ARE TAKING A PIECE OF MY ACTION. I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU TAKE DOWN THIS COP THAT'S BEEN SHAKING ME AND I'LL PAY ASUKA WHAT I OWE HER. IS IT A DEAL?
THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THIS HAUL. BACK TO THE DOCKS.
THAT WASN'T SO BAD. BACK TO THE BARTENDER... HMM, WAIT. LOOKS LIKE IT'S PLAYTIME AGAIN.
THAT WON'T BE HAPPENING. THE MAFIA DOESN'T RUN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ANYMORE. WE DO. THIS IS OUR MONEY!
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED. WE'RE LEAVING IN STYLE, MIKE! LEAVE IT THERE AND COME BACK.
THAT'S JUST PLAIN WRONG, DUDE. THERE GOES MY 'REPEAL THE CAR TAX' BUMPER STICKER...
THAT'S NO WAY TO GO THROUGH LIFE, KID. BEING IN JAIL, I MEAN.
THAT'S NOT LIKE 8-BALL TO BE ON THE RUN. SOMETHING OR SOMEONE MUST HAVE HIM REAL SPOOKED.
THAT'S ONE WAY OF HANDLING IT. TAKE ME BACK TO THE BAR.
THAT'S RIGHT, DARLING - NO GUNS, JUST HAND-TO-HAND OR A BASEBALL BAT IF YOU FEEL INTIMIDATED. OH, AND LEAVE THE REST OF THE PLAYERS ALONE... THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FIELD A FULL ROSTER COME SUNDAY.
THAT'S THE LAST MISTAKE YOU'LL MAKE. HMM... I'M IN TROUBLE.
THAT'S THE PLACE. NO SECOND THOUGHTS NOW, MIKE. I'M PAYING YOU GOOD MONEY. - JONNIE
THAT'S THE SPIRIT, YUKA. I'LL BE SURE YOU AREN'T HARMED BY MY EMPLOYER.
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG, VINNIE. I'M NOT THAT KID YOU REMEMBER ME AS. I'VE HAD TO DO MORE DESPICABLE THINGS TRYING TO TRACK DOWN YOUR KILLER THAT I'VE BECOME LIKE YOU VINNIE... LIKE YOU. 
THE BASTARD ONLY BROUGHT FIVE THOUSAND WITH HIM. BETTER HEAD BACK TO THE BARTENDER WITH THE LOOT.
THE BIG SCORE
THE CAR WAS DESTROYED.
THE COPS AND SECURITY GUARDS ARE ON TO YOU, MIKE-SAN! GET OUT OF THERE! DON'T FORGET TO BRING ME HIS SHOES. - ASUKA
THE COPS ARE ON TO ME SINCE I JUST TOOK OUT HALF OF THE CARTEL GANG. I'D BETTER LOSE THEM.
THE COPS ARE ON TO YOU. NOTICE THE TWO STARS MARKED ON YOUR HUD IN THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER OF THE SCREEN. GO TO THE @8PAY 'N' SPRAY@0 OR RUN OVER STAR PICKUPS TO REDUCE YOUR WANTED LEVEL TO ZERO AND THEN RETURN TO THE RESTAURANT TO MEET VINNIE.
THE COPS ARE RIGHT BEHIND ME. BETTER NOT LEAD THEM TO THE HIDEOUT.
THE COURSE IS A LITTLE TRICKIER THIS TIME, DUDE. WE'LL SEE HOW YOU HANDLE THIS YAKUZA WITH SOME COMPETITION ON YOUR BUTT. YOU'VE GOT FOUR MINUTES TO COMPLETE THE RACE.
THE GUYS UPSTAIRS SAID THEY COULD USE A HAND WITH A SMALL-TIME PUSHER NAMED FEDERICO. HE'S BEEN USING MORE OF THEIR PRODUCT THAN SELLING IT WHICH IS BAD FOR BUSINESS. TAKE HIM OUT AND THE MAFIA WILL HELP US.
THE HIGHER THE MONKEY GOES, THE MORE HE'S EXPOSED, MON.
THE KID'S INNOCENT, MAKE SURE NOTHING HAPPENS TO HER. YOU DON'T WANT TO CROSS ME IN THIS, CISCO.
THE LAST TWO CARS ARE F1 RACING CARS.  YOU'LL NEED THE SPEED, BECAUSE AFTER THE LAST JOB, EVERYONE IS TOWN WILL BE AFTER YOU.
THE MAFIA HAS CLOSED DOWN THE BRIDGE, MIKE-SAN. THERE'S NO ESCAPE NOW. PLEASE TAKE COMFORT IN THIS BEFORE THEY GET YOU - I'LL NEVER LOVE ANOTHER MAN!
THE MAFIA WANTS PAYBACK. TAKE OUT THREE HOODS IN TRENTON.
THE MOVIE STUDIO HAS STUCK ALL THEIR GUARDS ONTO YOU, MIKE-SAN! GET OUT OF THERE! - ASUKA
THE NAME'S MIKE. NOW TELL ME MORE SO I CAN BELIEVE YOU.
THE NERVE OF SOME WOMEN! I TELL YOU THAT BACK IN MY COUNTRY, MY WORD WENT UNCHALLENGED AND MY DEBTS UNPAID! WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS... A FAVORITE FAMILY MEMBER, PERHAPS... YES! PAT HAS A DOGGIE SHE LOVES. I WILL KIDNAP THIS DOGGIE - IN THE MEANTIME, HEAD OVER TO A BUTCHER'S SHOP I OWN. GET SOME GROUND MEAT AND STUFF IT INTO THIS PAIR OF HOLLOWED-OUT SHOES. TELL HER SHE'LL MEET HER DOGGIE'S FATE IF SHE DOESN'T COOPERATE! PERHAPS THAT WILL BE INCENTIVE ENOUGH FOR HER TO CONTINUE HER WORK!
THE POLICE ARE AFTER YOU FOR THE BOMBER'S MURDER! WATCH OUT! - ASUKA.
THE POLICE HAVE CLOSED DOWN THE AIRPORT! I'VE GOT NOWHERE TO GO NOW.
THE RESTAURANT IS IN PORTLAND BEACH. SHOULD BE REAL EASY TO SPOT, TOO.
THE ROCKET LAUNCHER
THE YARDIES ARE SPREAD OUT ALL OVER THE CITY GETTING READY TO TAKE ME DOWN. I'M GOING TO HIT THEM FIRST BEFORE THEY'RE ON TO ME.
THERE ARE BODYGUARDS OUT FRONT. EITHER TAKE THEM ON OR LOOK FOR ANOTHER ENTRANCE AROUND BACK.
THERE ARE BUTTONS ON THE WHEEL JUST LIKE A COMPUTER GAME. GET ON WITH YOUR BAD SELF!
THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT CLIENTS WHO WANT SOME ACTION AT LUIGI'S.
THERE ARE STILL 8 CARS LEFT.  A LITTLE HARDER THIS TIME.  SOMEONE WILL BE DRIVING THEM.
THERE ARE THREE WOMEN LOOKING FOR A RIDE. ESCORT THE LADIES INDIVIDUALLY TO THEIR DESTINATIONS MARKED ON THE RADAR.
THERE NOW, WITH THIS THUG'S DEATH, IT'LL KEEP THE WORD FROM GETTING OUT TO THE WHOLE CITY THAT I'M TAKING ON THE CARTEL GANG.
THERE'S A COUNTER CENTERED ON THE TOP OF THE SCREEN TO KEEP TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF COFFEE CANS YOU'VE COLLECTED.
THEY ORDERED A CAR TO PICK EM UP BUT I HAVE NO ONE TO DRIVE THEM.
THEY'LL EXPECT TO BE TAKEN TO THE SUBWAY, BUT TAKE THEM SOMEWHERE QUIET AND SILENCE THEM.
THEY'LL KNOW IT WAS ME, YOU FOOL! ALL MY PRECIOUS CLOTHING, GONE! PRISON GRAY FOR ME...
THEY'RE THREATENING TO TAKE HIM IN UNLESS HE DOUBLES THEIR PRICE.
THEY'VE DISCOVERED THE RUSE, AMIGO! BUBONIC PLAGUE WILL SPREAD THROUGH THE CITY LIKE WILDFIRE BECAUSE OF YOU!
THINGS LOOK GOOD OUT FRONT. I'D BETTER CHECK INSIDE.
THINK YOU CAN TAKE ME PUNK?! HOW 'BOUT WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS?
THINK! THINK OF SOMETHING QUICK, THE COPS ARE CLOSING IN.... I CAN'T MAKE IT OUT OF THE CITY BY THE HIGHWAYS, THE COPS WILL HAVE ROADBLOCKS UP. THERE'S ONLY ONE SHOT I HAVE AND THAT'S MAKE IT TO THE AIRPORT AND TAKE CISCO'S PLANE. DAMN, I WISH I HAD A TANK TO GET THROUGH THE RESISTANCE I'VE GOT COMING FOR ME.
THINK, MIKE! LET HIM GO OR RISK HAVING HIM ALERT THE AUTHORITIES?
THIS BABY AIN'T WHAT YOU'D CALL A TIGHT HANDLER. IN FACT, SHE'S GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME ROOM TO WIGGLE AROUND. YOU'VE GOT SOME COMPETITION AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRY RUNNIN' YOU OFF THE ROAD. THE COURSE'S RANDOM, YOU GOT FIVE MINUTES TO COMPLETE IT.
THIS BETTER BE THE LAST OF THEM. I'M STARTING TO HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS.
THIS CAN'T BE A NORMAL SCHOOL GIRL UNLESS YOU NEED SOMEONE TO TEACH YOU PROPER ENGLISH?
THIS CAR CHASE HAS MADE ME SICK. TAKE ME HOME BEFORE I PUKE.
THIS CAR'S AN EMBARRASSMENT. IT DESERVES A FIERY DEATH.
THIS GUY'S NO PUSHOVER AND MY PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO DEAL MOSTLY WITH THE GANG WAR BETWEEN THE MAFIA AND US. IN JAPAN, SNACK BARS ARE HOSTESS CLUBS WHERE YOU CAN GO IN TO GET A QUICK NIBBLE AND SING KARAOKE.
THIS IS A NICE GETUP YOU'VE GOT HERE, CISCO. YOU LOOK READY TO FLEE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE. WHO'D YOU BLACKMAIL THIS TIME?
THIS IS A RESTRICTED AREA UNLESS YOU'RE ON THE LIST. WELL, ARE YOU ON THE LIST?
THIS IS A VERY DELICATE MATTER, AMIGO AND IT WOUNDS ME - MUCH LIKE YOU DID MOST RECENTLY IN FACT - TO HEAR YOU SPEAK SO BLUNTLY. THESE PRODUCTS ARE PURELY FOR ERGONOMIC REASONS, DELIVER THESE SUPPLIES OUT FRONT TO THREE OF MY SHOPS. WE'RE IN A FIERCE STRUGGLE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH ARES, OUR MAIN COMPETITOR, AND THEY'D EXPLOIT ANY BAD PRESS. HOW DOES MY FACE LOOK TODAY? IT FEELS PUFFY.
THIS IS AS FAR AS WE GO, MIKE-SAN. THAT COMPOUND'S A DEATHTRAP AND ASUKA HAS FORBIDDEN US TO ENTER.
THIS IS IT, MIKE. I'VE GOT A LOT OF HEAT ON ME FROM PEOPLE I'M IN DEBT TO. I NEED TO DRUM UP SOME MONEY FAST. THIS GUY FREDDY HAS BEEN PLAYING ME FOR A FOOL WITH MARKED CARDS. MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF HIM AND BRING BACK HIS LOOT.
THIS IS IT, PLAYA', THE RACE EVERYONE'S BEEN WAITIN' FOR. IT'S THE FINAL RACE OF THE SEASON AND THE ROUTE IS LONGER THAN WHAT YOU'RE USED TO. YOU'VE GOT NINE MINUTES TO RACE AROUND THE CIRCUIT THREE TIMES IN A FORMULA ONE CAR. IT'S ONLY YOU OUT THERE PLAYA', DON'T FREEZE UP!
THIS IS MY LUCKY DAY. I KNOW WHERE YUKA IS BEING KEPT BUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS MONEY?
THIS IS OUR BIG CHANCE, MIKE. WE'VE ALMOST GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO LEAVE LIBERTY CITY FOR GOOD. I'M TIRED OF PLAYING ERRAND BOY. WE NEED TO STRIKE OFF ON OUR OWN AND LEAD THE GOOD LIFE.
THIS IS SHOW TIME, PLAYA'! YOU CAN'T PUT IT ON CRUISE CONTROL AND EXPECT TO WIN.
THIS IS THE BIG LEAGUES, BABY, YOU WANT TO BE A SPECTATOR?
THIS IS THE DEMOLITION FOOTBALL GAME. THERE ARE FOUR JUMPS OR 'PASSES' THAT MUST BE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. THE FOUR JUMPS ARE AT 20, 50, 80 AND 100 YARDS RESPECTIVELY. THE TRICK IS DRIVING YOUR CAR AT THE RIGHT SPEED IN ORDER TO JUMP THE REQUIRED DISTANCE. JUMP TOO FAR AND YOU'RE OUT OF BOUNDS.
THIS IS THE LAST RACE I GOT TO OFFER YOU, DUDE. YOU'RE DRIVING THE MANANA - A SOLID BABY IN ALL RESPECTS. I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE DISPLEASED RIDING IN HER SADDLE. YOU'VE GOT SOME COMPETITION AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRY RUNNIN' YOU OFF THE ROAD. STAY ON TRACK AND FINISH THE CIRCUIT IN THREE AND A HALF MINUTES.
THIS IS THE LAST RACE OF THIS ISLAND, BIG MAN. YOU'VE GOT THE SCREAMER AGAIN, THE BANSHEE. TAKE THE SCREAMING GAL AROUND THE CIRCUIT TWO TIMES IN FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES. EVERYBODY'S WATCHING YOU NOW!
THIS IS VOLATILE STUFF. I WOULDN'T BE SMOKIN' NEAR IT IF I WAS YOU.
THIS ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE, KID. BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.
THIS STUFF IS MORE POWERFUL THAN WHAT MY GRANDFATHER USED TO MAKE IN RUSSIA. HE DIED YOUNG, YOU KNOW.
THIS STUFF WILL KEEP YOU WARM ENOUGH TO GO OUTSIDE NAKED. REMINDS ME OF MY FRATERNITY DAYS.
THIS STUFF'S THE BOMB! I FORGOT MY WIFE'S NAME AFTER A FEW SIPS AND FOUND A GIRLFRIEND AFTER A COUPLE MORE!

WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE BODY FAST. I KNOW THE FELLOWS AT THE JUNKYARD AND THEY WON'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS. I'VE GOT A JUNKER OUTSIDE THAT YOU CAN USE. IT'D BE FITTING IF YOU BURIED HIM IN IT. I'VE PUT THE BODY IN THE TRUNK SO YOU TAKE CARE OF THE REST.
WE NEED TO TAKE HIM OUT BEFORE HE SPILLS HIS BEANS ON OUR OPERATIONS.
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE A WINNER, BUT YOU'RE JUST A PRETENDER.
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT, KING. TIME TO BRING OUT THE BIG GUNS.
WE'LL SEE WHAT CISCO HAS TO SAY ABOUT THIS.
WE'LL SEE WHO'S THE FOOL HERE. I'M NOT ALONE AND HELPLESS LIKE YOU THOUGHT! LET'S GET IT ON...
WE'RE REAL CLOSE HERE, MIKE, BUT BEFORE WE CAN LEAVE, WE WILL NEED SOME FAKE IDS. THE GUY THAT RUNS THE BOMB SHOP, 8-BALL, IS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE. HE'LL BE ABLE TO HOOK YOU UP. HE'S PROBABLY HANGING OUT AT HIS PAD RIGHT NOW.
WEAPONS
WELCOME TO THE HOME STADIUM OF THE LIBERTY CITY COCKS. I KNOW YOU, PLAYA', YOU'RE MORE INTERESTED IN THE CHEERLEADER ACTION ON THE SIDELINES. HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO IMPRESS THEM WITH A GAME I CALL DEMOLITION FOOTBALL. YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE FOUR JUMPS OF VARYING LENGTH: 20, 50, 80, AND A 100 YARDS. YOU GET FOUR TRIES OR 'DOWNS' TO ACCOMPLISH EACH JUMP. FAIL FOUR JUMPS IN A ROW AND THE GAME'S OVER - NO VICTORY DANCE FOR YOU.
WELL DONE KID!
WELL, ASUKA MAY NOT BE HAPPY WITH A BODY BAG BUT HER CUSTOMERS WON'T BE DYING OF FOOD POISONING EITHER.
WELL, I DECIDED I WANTED TO KEEP MY CASH AFTER ALL. GET HIM GUYS!
WELL, I SEE THE CULPRIT DIDN'T MAKE IT TO ME ALIVE. WHAT A PITY BUT NO MATTER. HE SHOULD MAKE A NICE MEAL FOR THE BLOWFISH THOUGH.
WELL, I THOUGHT TO MAKE AN OBJECT LESSON OUT OF A FEW OF THEIR THUGS. I WANT TO SET UP AN INDENTURED SERVANT RING IN EAST ASIA AND I WANT YOU TO ROUND UP MAFIA 'VOLUNTEERS'. TAKE THIS KATANA; IT'S A FAMILY HEIRLOOM. 'ENLIST' AS MANY MAFIA THUGS AS YOU CAN WITH IT AND WE'LL SEND THEM OUT ON A CARGO SHIP TONIGHT. I EXPECT AT LEAST FIFTEEN MAFIA THUGS BUT WILL REWARD YOU HANDSOMELY IF YOU BRING ME MORE, MIKE-SAN.
WELL, IF A CERTAIN CAR WERE TO BE PLACED AT A CERTAIN SPOT AND HAD A MAJOR MALFUNCTION - I WOULDN'T BE DISPLEASED. TAKE THE IDAHO OUT FRONT - IT'S A DAMN EYESORE. THE WINDOWS WERE SHATTERED BY THE BASS VIBRATIONS COMING OUT OF THAT PLACE. DRIVE THE CAR OVER TO 8-BALL'S SHOP AND KEEP IT IN REASONABLE SHAPE - HE'LL SET YOU UP.
WELL, IF I DON'T LEAVE ANY WITNESSES ALIVE, I MIGHT HAVE AN EVEN CHANCE.
WELL, MISTER, MY AUNT'S MEN ARE CLOSING IN. YOU'RE NOT SO BAD, I'LL TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING WORSE THAN A SPANKING.
WELL, WELL. I SUPPOSE I COULD WAIT AND TAKE THEM ON THE WAY BACK FROM THE MEETING. WHERE ARE THOSE DAMN YARDIES?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?  OH, YOU MADE IT.  UH, GOOD JOB GUYS.
WHAT DO I DO WITH THE INNOCENT DRIVERS?
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT?
WHAT HAVE I ALWAYS TOLD YOU, KID? DON'T MESS WITH THE BRASS UNLESS THEY'RE WEARING SKIRTS.
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS? WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!? YOU AIN'T GETTING ANY CASH FOR THIS.. I'LL FIND MY OWN WAY!
WHAT THE HELL YOU HIT MY TRUCK FOR?
WHAT THE HELL? IT LOOKS LIKE A MASSACRE, THE BARTENDER IS LYING IN A POOL OF BLOOD. I THOUGHT HE WAS BEING PARANOID ABOUT THE DANGER HE WAS IN.
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT, 8-BALL?
WHAT YOU SMOKING, MON? I TOLD YOU TO LAY YOUR BARE HANDS ON HIM!
WHAT'RE YOU DOING, MON? YOU'VE GOT TO STAY IN THE CAR!
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, SONNY? YOU CRAZY OR SOMETHING?
WHAT'S IT TO YOU?
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA OF TAILGATING? I HAVE A VERY BUSY SCHEDULE AND NO TIME FOR THIS!
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS? SHOES STUFFED WITH RAW MEAT? DESPICABLE!!
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? A FREE TRIP? I'VE NEVER BEEN OUT OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD.
WHAT'S THIS GOT TO DO WITH US GETTING OUT OF THE CITY?
WHAT'S THIS, MON? WHY ARE YOU SITTING AND WORKING WITH THE ENEMY!?!
WHAT'S VINNIE GOT ME COLLECTING BLOOD MONEY FOR?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, KID? YOU WANT TO BE STUCK HERE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?
WHATEVER, VINNIE BROUGHT ME OUT OF THE DUMPS AND TAUGHT ME HOW TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. KEEP LOOKING INTO IT.
WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE'S VINNIE?
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? I WON'T TELL YOU A THING!
WHO KNOWS? LOOK - I KNOW YOU'RE THIRSTING FOR BLOOD, BUT DON'T THINK EVERYBODY YOU SEE OUT ON THE STREET IS THE KILLER. THE GIRLS WILL BE BACK SOON. LET'S SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY FIRST.
WHO THE HELL YOU THINK YOU ARE? YOU'RE A DEAD MAN, AMIGO, YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT YET.
WHO'S 'HE'? AND WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? ARE YOU WORKING FOR THE GUY WHO KILLED THE BOMBER?
WHOOPY
WHY DON'T YOU START A PETITION TO REMOVE HIM INSTEAD?
WHY YOU DOIN' THIS TO ME, JONNIE? DON'T YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU?
WICHITA GARDENS
WOAH!!! I DON'T TOUCH
WOAH!!! I DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING THAT HOT!!!
WONG
WRAP IT UP QUICK, VINNIE. I DON'T LIKE THIS KIND OF WORK

YATTA! GOOD JOB, MIKE-SAN. LEAVE THE QUARTERBACK ALONE NOW AND COME BACK TO ME. - ASUKA
YEAH MISTA', LISTEN UP 'CAUSE THIS RACE'S A BIT DIFFERENT. MY BOY LOCO'S BEHIND THE LAYOUT OF THIS RACE AND HE DOESN'T LIKE IT ORDERLY. IN OTHER WORDS, THE RACE SPOTS ARE RANDOM. YOU GOT FIVE MINUTES TO MAKE IT AROUND THE CIRCUIT IN THIS DIABLO. GOOD LUCK!
YEAH RIGHT, YOU AND EVERY OTHER CREEP IN THIS TOWN.
YEAH, I DID HEAR SOMETHING. DOESN'T SEEM THAT THE MAFIA HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH VINNIE'S DEATH. THEY GOT GUYS OUT LOOKING FOR WHO KILLED HIM AND SOMETHING ABOUT MONEY OWED TO THEM.
YEAH, I SAW THE DEAD BODIES OUT FRONT. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, 8-BALL. I'M GLAD THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO TAKE YOU DOWN.
YEAH, I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T READY FOR THE CHALLENGE.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. HERE'S SOME DOUGH TO PURCHASE A PISTOL. HEAD OVER TO AMMU-NATION AND TELL 'EM I SENT YOU - NO WAY YOU'D PASS THE BACKGROUND CHECK WITH YOUR RECORD...
YES
YES, MON. COME BACK. - KING

YES, THE LATEST STYLE. PEOPLE CAN PUT THEIR IDS, KEYS, AND OTHER COLLECTIBLES IN THE SOLES OF THEIR SHOES. BRILLIANT!
YO! YOU'RE NOT THE NORMAL GUY - WHERE'S FREDDY?
YO, MAN! DON'T BRING THE COPS DOWN ON ME. COME BACK WHEN YOU'RE NOT A WANTED MAN.
YOKATTA! YOU'VE RETURNED MY SWEET, DARLING YUKA TO ME, MIKE-SAN. YOU HAVE MY THANKS... PERHAPS I COULD EXPRESS THEM MORE INTIMATELY INSIDE MY BEDROOM? TELL ME, HAVE YOU EVER FELT THE CRACK OF A WHIP ACROSS YOUR BACK?
YOU ALERTED THE GUARDS BEFORE TAKING YUKA. MY PLANS ARE RUINED! YOU WILL BE PUNISHED SEVERELY, AMIGO.
YOU AREN'T MAN ENOUGH TO BE WITH ME.
YOU ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS, YOU KNOW? JUST DON'T MESS UP LIKE FEDERICO DID AND THE MAFIA WILL HELP US OUT.
YOU BLEW THE STASH, MON! YOU'RE UP TO NO GOOD!
YOU BROUGHT THE HEAT BACK WITH YOU, KID. ROOKIE MOVE.

YOU CAN'T HANDLE A FINE MACHINE LIKE THAT. SHE'S TOO GOOD FOR YA.
YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE RAT RACE, MON.
YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE WIDE LOADS, DUDE.
YOU DAMN BROKE MY JAW, PUNK. YOU CAN HAVE THE DAMN FISH, IT AIN'T WORTH FIGHTING OVER.
YOU DIDN'T DELIVER THE MESSAGE, KID! NOW WE'LL ONLY BE ABLE TO SMOKE IN THE IRISH PUBS.
YOU DIDN'T DO WHAT I TOLD YOU! I'M GOING TO TELL MY DAD YOU TOUCHED ME. YOU'RE DEAD!
YOU DISAPPOINT ME, K-CHAN BUT NO MATTER. THE ASSASSIN THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS THE SAME THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR PARTNER VINNIE'S DEATH. I'M TRACKING DOWN HIS LOCATION NOW. AS SOON AS I KNOW, YOU'LL KNOW.
YOU DONE WELL KID, I SEE BIG THINGS FOR YOU HERE.
YOU GOT AN OVERLOAD OF TESTOSTERONE, DON'T YOU? WE'LL MAKE A GIRL OUT OF YOU BEFORE WE'RE DONE! KILL HIM!
YOU GOT THAT MAGIC TOUCH, BABY! YOU'VE CLOSED OUT THE ACTION HERE. TRY YOUR LUCK ON SHORESIDE OR CHECK OUT WHAT I CALL DEMOLITION FOOTBALL AT THE LIBERTY CITY STADIUM.
YOU HAVE 60 SECONDS TO RETURN TO A POLICE VEHICLE BEFORE THE MISSION ENDS.
YOU HAVE A CRUEL SENSE OF RETRIBUTION, ASUKA. REMIND ME NEVER TO CROSS YOU.
YOU HAVE BOUGHT:
YOU HAVING A MENTAL BREAKDOWN, MON? DON'T GO CRAZY BEHIND BARS!
YOU HIGH ON FUMES, KID?
YOU JUST PUT MR MAVSON IN A BODY BAG.. MISSION FAILED!
YOU KILLED BILLY! HOW COULD YOU? THE LOVE OF MY LIFE, GONE! I HATE YOU!
YOU KILLED TOO MANY AND THE MAFIA HAVE BEEN WARNED! YOU HAVE COLLECTED LESS THAN FIFTEEN MAFIA THUGS WHICH ISN'T WORTH THE GANG WAR THAT'S ABOUT TO START. WE'LL HAVE TO BLAME IT ON YOU, K-KUN. SHIKATAGANAI...
YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT POLITICS, MIKE? I HOPE YOU'RE STILL UNDECLARED BECAUSE I'VE GOT A SITUATION. THIS SENATOR WANTS TO BAN SMOKING IN RESTAURANTS AND BARS AND HE JUST ABOUT HAS THE VOTES TO DO IT. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU IT'D BE BAD FOR BUSINESS, DO I? WHY DON'T YOU SEE IF YOU CAN PERSUADE THE SENATOR TO CHANGE HIS MIND.
YOU KNOW THE ROUTINE; THIS TIME YOU'RE HANDLING A BANSHEE - A REAL SCREAMER. YOU'VE GOT TWO AND A HALF MINUTES TO COMPLETE THE RACE.
YOU LED THE COPS TO YOUR PAD! ROOKIE MOVE, KID.
YOU LOOK LIKE ANY OTHER DRUG-PUSHER IN A FANCY SUIT. I'LL BE SEEING YOU.
YOU LOSING YOUR GUTS ON ME? DON'T MAKE ME REGRET HELPING YOU OUT WHEN YOU HAD NOTHING. GET OUT THERE.
YOU LOST BILLY, NOW DRIVE THE GIRL HOME BEFORE SHE PUKES.
YOU LOST YOUR EDGE, KID. I DON'T KNOW WHY I BOTHER.
YOU MESS WITH ME AND YOU'RE MESSIN' WITH ALL OF LIBERTY CITY!
YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT YOUR OWN PROBLEMS, KING. THIS SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SETTING THIS GUY UP TO TAKE CARE OF A TURF WAR YOU GOT GOING ON.
YOU RODE HER LIKE THE BEAST YOU ARE! GOOD JOB!
YOU SAVED ME! YOU KNOW, MY DADDY COULD GET YOU A CUSHY JOB IN POLITICS.
YOU SAVED MY NECK ON THIS ONE, MIKE. LITERALLY...
YOU SEEM AT A LOSS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE ABOUT WHO'S BEHIND THIS. I'D BETTER TRACK DOWN THE ONE LEAD I HAVE, WHETHER IT'S A TRAP OR NOT.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE CHEATED ON MARY IN BADFELLAS, BIFF. REAP THE REWARD!
YOU SHOULDN'T KEEP A GIRL WAITING! ESPECIALLY A HOT ONE LIKE ME WHOSE DADDY WILL KILL ANYONE WHO LOOKS AT ME TWICE!
YOU THINK ME CRAVEN, MON? NO MATTER. I'M GOING TO EASE YOUR STRESS FOR GOOD!
YOU THINKIN' THE GRASS IS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE? COME BACK WHEN YOU'RE COMMITTED.
YOU TOO, MAN. BUT THIS ISN'T OVER YET, I THINK THERE'LL BE MORE PEOPLE GUNNIN' FOR YOU. THE WORD'S OUT THAT YOU TOOK DOWN VINNIE AND THAT YOU'VE GOT HIS MONEY.
YOU WERE FLYIN', MY MAN! BUT DON'T GET TOO COCKY - THE LADIES AREN'T IMPRESSED WITH THAT RIDE.
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO PICK THEM UP.. NOT KILL THEM STRAIGHT AWAY!
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE CARS.
YOU WIN! I GIVE UP... I'M PROBABLY GOING TO MY SLAUGHTER WITH ASUKA BUT I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.
YOU WON'T LIKE THE PRISON FOOD, KID, BUT ENJOY THE MAN-LOVE!
YOU WORKED HER, MAN. YEAH LOOK AT THAT STEAM COMIN' OFF HER - SHE LOOKS REAL HAPPY.
YOU WOULD BE PROUD, AMIGO! I'M PLACING MY MOST FASHIONABLE SHOES ON YOUR DEAD CORPSE'S FEET FOR THE OPEN CASKET SERVICE.
YOU'LL NEVER GET OUT OF HERE ALIVE!
YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE. HA! HA!
YOU'RE A FAILURE, MON! PLAIN AND SIMPLE AS THE BABY'S BEHIND!
YOU'RE A LITTLE SLOW IN THE TURNING, MON. YOU'VE GOT TO EASE UP, NOT FREEZE UP AND PUT THE PEDAL DOWN!
YOU'RE A QUALIFIER, MON! YOU'RE READY FOR STEPPING IT UP AND BEING A REAL RACE DRIVER. COME BACK TO MY HEADQUARTERS AND I'LL PUT THE WORD TO YOU.
YOU'RE A VICIOUS ONE, MIKE-SAN! WITH THE BLOODBATH YOU UNLEASHED, I'VE HAD TO MOVE UP THE DEADLINE FOR DEPARTURE. BRING THE SCUM YOU HAVE TO THE DOCKS BEFORE THE FREIGHTER LEAVES PORT. - ASUKA
YOU'RE AN ARROGANT PUNK, AREN'T YOU? YOU'RE IN NO SITUATION TO BE GIVING ORDERS. SAY HELLO TO MY GANG.
YOU'RE BLAZING FAST, MON. SMOKING RED! THE LADIES ARE SHOUTING YOUR NAME, MIKE! MIKE!
YOU'RE CRAZY, PRINCESS! YOU'RE ON TOP OF THE MAFIA'S HIT LIST NOW. WE'LL BE BACK.
YOU'RE DRIVIN' AN IDAHO - FASTER THAN A BRIT BUT NOT BY MUCH. YOU'VE GOT SOME COMPETITION AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRY RUNNIN' YOU OFF THE ROAD. STAY ON TRACK AND FINISH THE CIRCUIT IN TWO MINUTES.
YOU'RE FAST - I LIKE THAT! HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO PROVE IT AGAIN FOR SOME EXTRA CASH. DROP OFF THREE DIABLOS IN MINT CONDITION AT THE MANSION IN PORTLAND BEACH. I'LL EXPLAIN LATER. - 8-BALL
YOU'RE GOING TO END UP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN, PAL, NOT ME!
YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR KILLING CISCO! HE TREATED YOU LIKE A SON AND HAD HIGH HOPES OF EDUCATING YOU IN FASHION SENSE AND THE MERITS OF GIVING DRIVER LICENSES TO ILLEGALS! THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY HIM?
YOU'RE GOING TO PAY, MUCHACHO. EAT SOME OF MY LEAD!
YOU'RE GOING TO WISH YOU WERE DEAD, AMIGO. HOW DARE YOU DISAPPOINT ME!
YOU'RE JUST A THUG, AREN'T YOU? TAKE ME HOME BEFORE I GET ANGRY.
YOU'RE MORE OF A PUNK THAN VINNIE WAS!
YOU'RE NO FUN, MIKE-SAN! YOU CAN'T RESIST MY CHARMS FOR MUCH LONGER...
YOU'RE NOT A BAD DRIVER MON, BUT YOU'RE NOT READY FOR THE BIG LEAGUES. KEEP YOUR DAY JOB OF HUSTLING AND DO SOME PIMPING ON THE SIDE!
YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME, ARE YOU?
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE BAD MEN THAT MY AUNT ASUKA WATCHES MOVIES ABOUT, AREN'T YOU? DON'T TOUCH ME AND I'LL BEHAVE.
YOU'RE ONE SICK LADY, ASUKA. I'LL BE SEEING YOU AROUND.
YOU'RE STARTING TO MAKE A NAME FOR YOURSELF AROUND HERE. ALL THE LADIES ARE LININ' UP FOR YA.
YOU'RE STARTING TO MAKE A NAME FOR YOURSELF!
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BEAT THE COMPETITION WITH YOUR DRIVING, MON, NOT BLOW HIM UP!
YOU'RE TAKING TOO LONG, MON! THOSE CARTEL BASTARDS ARE ORGANIZING A RESISTANCE AND THEY'RE COMING FOR ME!
YOU'RE THE WINNA', CHAMP, AND THE FORMULA ONE CAR IS YOURS! HEAR THEM SHOUTIN' YOUR NAME? AIN'T NO GIRL'S GONNA BE ABLE TO RESIST YOUR CHARMS!
YOU'VE BEEN SPOTTED, AMIGO! LOSE YOUR TAILS AND THEN COME BACK HERE WITH THE GIRL. - CISCO
YOU'VE BEEN SPOTTED, FRIEND! LOSE YOUR TAILS AND THEN COME BACK HERE WITH THE GIRL.
YOU'VE GOT A THICK SKULL, GRAMPS!
YOU'VE GOT THREE MINUTES UNTIL YUKA IS OUT OF SCHOOL AND WAITING FOR HER LIMO. DON'T BE LATE!
YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIRE A GUY WHO'S WILLING TO TURN ASUKA DOWN EVEN IF HE'S A MEMBER OF THE 'GIVE AMERICA BACK TO FOREIGN POWERS' LOBBYIST GROUP. ENJOY YOUR FREEDOM AWAY FROM ASUKA, BIFF.
YOU'VE TAKEN TOO LONG TO FIND THE CULPRIT AND THE BAD BLOWFISH HAS CLAIMED MORE LIVES! MY REPUTATION IS RUINED! BAKA!
YOUR EPITAPH IS GOING TO READ, 'BORN DUMB, DIED STUPID'.
YOUR IGNORANCE IS AS OBVIOUS AS A FOUL STENCH. I WOULD HAVE NO INVOLVEMENT WITH SUCH PETTY CRIMINALS, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE AS RAGGEDLY DRESSED AS YOURSELF.
